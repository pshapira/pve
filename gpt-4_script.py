  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that categorizes the sentences into 'Public Value Expression' or 'No Public Value'. If the sentence is categorized as 'Public Value Expression', further classify it into 'Direct PVE' or 'Contextual PVE'. Use the following definitions:\n\n\
  Public Value Expression: A public value expression (PVE) is one that indicates societal benefits promised to or for people, organizations, or ecosystems.  Societal benefits for people includes, among other aspects, potential enhancement of safety, security, privacy, justice, equality, human rights, civil liberties, health, and avoidance of bias and discrimination. Social benefits generated at the organizational level include, among other aspects, enhancements in accountability, transparency, honesty, responsibility and security which are not purely pecuniary and that create shared utility for users and networks. Societal benefits for ecosystems include, among other aspects, enhancements to sustainability, nature and the environment. Enhancement includes both positive improvement and the mitigation or prevention of adverse conditions.\n\n\
  No Public Value: Do not code a sentence as a 'Public Value Expression' if it only refers to information technology or other technical aspects without any explicit indication of broader societal benefits. Do not code a sentence as 'Public Value Expression' if its benefits present only as accruing to the assignee organization (private value) without any explicit indication of broader societal benefit. Absent such explicit indication, do not code a sentence as 'Public Value Expression' by generalizing from private value to public value based on inferences (by the assistant) about potential connections. Avoid assumptions or inferences about potential positive or negative societal, economic, or environmental spillovers that are not explicitly stated. Furthermore, do not code a sentence as 'Public Value Expression' if it only refers to improving user experience. User experience enhancement does not imply Public Value Expression. User experience enhancement focuses on individual users, is narrow in scope and individualistic, and is measured with usability metrics (e.g., task completion, user satisfaction). PVE focuses on society as a whole, is broader in scope and societal, and is measured with social impact metrics (e.g., environmental impact, social justice, democratic participation).\n\n\
  Direct PVE: Code a sentence as a 'Direct PVE' if the sentence states that the invention being patented explicitly addresses one or more PVEs (see definition of public value expression).\n\n\
  Contextual PVE: Code a sentence as a 'Contextual PVE' if the sentence mentions a contextual situation that allows us to infer a concern or intention to create or protect PVEs. The sentence must be explicit in its reference to a public value or concern about a societal, environmental, or ethical concern. However, it is contextual because it is not explicitly connected to the invention being patented."},
  
  {"role": "user", "content": "an inventive solution to the need to prevent private information inferencing from document collections is presented."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's think step by step.
